# This Project (Or My Graduation Project)

## 介绍 Description
  - 正如你看到的 repository name，这是我的毕业设计前端项目，其实很简单 ( I don't lie )。之前在美剧《极品老妈》中了解到[匿名戒酒会 Alcoholics Anonymous](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%97%9C%E9%85%92%E8%80%85%E4%BA%92%E8%AF%AB%E5%8D%8F%E4%BC%9A/10338888?fr=aladdin)，我觉得他们很不容易，尤其看到有些人可以坚持几十年不在饮酒 (比如 Marjorie)，也有人因为饮酒甚至不能和自己的女儿见面 (比如 Bonnie 的 Sponsee) 更是如此。
  - As the name of the repository you see, this is the front-end project of my graduation design which is not that difficult or complicated (I don't lie :) ). AA(Alcoholics Anonymous) is known to me for the CBS sitcom *Mom*. Those people do struggle with the desire of alcohol for several months or for decades and they have lost or paid a lot for their drinking problems. Some people have stayed sober for decades like *Marjorie* and some can't even celebrate Christmas with their daughter for the messup that they made when drunken like *Bonnie's Sponsee*.
  - 说实话，我不知道这个系统是否会帮助 AA，甚至可能因为系统中的成员管理功能冒犯他们的隐私。当然，还是最开始的那句话，这只是我的毕业设计前端项目
